# Script for spline parametrization

This python script generates a cubic spline that is parameterized by its length.
I have not used any math libraries for it, so it is more understandable what the script does.

## Prerequisites

Following packages are required before installing the service:

* python3
* pip3

## Installation

````
git clone git@github.com:Simple-codinger/SplineParametrization.git
cd SplineParametrization
./dev-tools/install.sh
````

## Run

To start the script, run the following command:
````
./dev-tools/run.sh
````
